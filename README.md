Description
===========

A LXC template with Chef cookbooks to create a development enviroment for Aentos projects

This is a template for LXC plus a few utilities to bootstrap a Aentos project using Chef.

The template is functional, but still need some love. This also depends on the Chef cookbooks, which make the real bootstraping.


Install
=======

To install the templates and scripts you need to have installed in a Ubuntu/Debian box with the following dependencies:

* `lxc`
* `rake` (it doesn't matter if v√≠a system packages or gems)

Now you need to run:

```
$ sudo rake
```

NOTE: It's important to run the `rake` with `sudo` or as a root user.

This will download the cookbooks, will create a tarball to be used by the `chef-solo` and will copy the tarball and the script to your system.
You can see the rest of the rake tasks by doing:

```
$ rake -T
```

Usage
=====

First you need to run the `install.sh` script. Then you create a normal LXC container with `lxc-create`, but with the following parameters:

```
$ sudo lxc-create -t aentos -n [container-name]
```

Obviously, the `[container-name]` you choose will be the one use to refer to the container.

You can also pass some parameters to the themplate, like the IP the container should have, after `--`:

```
$ sudo lxc-create -t aentos -n superproject -- -i 10.0.3.51
```

After you create the container you need to provision it by doing:

```
$ lxc-provision superproject
```

or (if you have not dnsmasq working with you resolvconf):

```
$ lxc-provision 10.0.3.51
```

You also can use `lxc-console` or normal ssh connection to work inside the container. To connect via ssh with the container without password you can use a private key copied to `/var/cache/lxc/id_aentos_[container-name]` for this purpose.
There is also a handy command `lxc-ssh` which do the job. Here is how you can use it:

```
$ lxc-ssh superproject
```

In case you need it, the password for the `aentos` user is `aentos`.
